# Installation

Docker uses Linux-specific kernel features and therefore does not run natively on Windows. Docker Toolbox solves this by providing a command line interface to the docker engine running on a virtual machine equiped with a Linux kernel.

To use docker on Windows, download the Docker Toolbox at [https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox\_install\_windows/](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/)

### Steps to take

Make sure to select all components, only "Kitematic" is not required \(GUI\) in this course, but may be installed to manage containers more easily.

{% hint style="info" %}
 If you already have GIT \(a code version control system\) installed you can also leave this unchecked.
{% endhint %}

Next make sure to add docker binaries to your environment path!

### Launching the CLI

To start using the Docker Toolbox find the "**Docker QuickStart Terminal**" and launch it.

The first time you run the terminal app it will setup a virtual machine and do some configurations.

Shortly after the CLI should become available.
